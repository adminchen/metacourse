metaTED 2.1.0 (June 19, 2013)
=============================

Feature additions
-----------------

    * Fixed #13, #14: Switched to hard subtitled video download URLs, as there
      have been issues with externally hosted soft subtitles. The 'standard'
      quality level has unfortunately been removed, as TED doesn't provide hard
      subtitles for it.

    * Removed `theme` from `talk_info` metadata as TED stopped providing theme
      information in their HTML.

Bugfixes
--------

    * Updated author marker as TED updated their HTML layout.

    * Fixed #15: Updated code for finding talk urls as TED added pagination to
      their talk list page. Reintroduced `talks_urls` caching to improve
      performance.

metaTED 2.0.4 (October 16, 2012)

metaTED 2.0.0 (January 17, 2012)
================================

metaTED 2.0.0 has been in the works for some time. It's the bigest change yet in
the projects short lived 2.5 year history. Cool stuff has been added, bugs were
fixed, but the API has seen some backwards incompatible changes as well.

Feature additions
-----------------

    * Fixed issue #4 - Added talk subtitles support, as per popular request.
      Major thanks to Randall Mason for the initial implementation.

    * Added parallelism to the crawler, leading to substantial performance
      improvements.

    * Added filming year, publishing year and event name to talks metadata,
      which automagically added new possible talk groupings.

    * Added parallelism to the metalink generator, leading to substantial
      performance improvements.

Bugfixes
--------

    * Updated talk theme markers as TED updated their HTML layout and improved
      error handling.

    * Updated video download markers and download URLs detection code as TED
      updated their HTML layout.

    * Updated author markers and detection code as TED updated their HTML
      layout.

    * talk_info metadata cache is written to disk as soon as possible to
      minimize data loss on errors.

    * Removed `setup.cfg` as we no longer need it.

    * Removed the `dreamy-trac` project reference from `LICENSE`.

Internals
---------

    * Switched from using `setuptools` to `distribute` for packaging.

    * Removed crawler based page caching as it's no longer used nor needed.

    * Switched from `BeautifulSoup` to `lxml` and removed custom crawler code in
      favor of `lxml.html.parse`.

    * Minimal Python version bumped from 2.4+ to 2.6+.

    * Major refactoring to modernize existing codebase, while improving code
      style, optimizing performance and getting rid of accumulated technical
      debt. Existing API has suffered a bit.
